# SuperMart - Supermarket POS & Inventory Management System

A high-fidelity frontend client demo for **SuperMart**, an intelligent supermarket billing and inventory management application designed with a modern glassmorphic aesthetic. Built entirely with clean vanilla **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, persisting state directly in `localStorage` with zero backend dependencies. Fully structured for effortless future conversion into Laravel Blade templates, controllers, and REST APIs.

## 🚀 How to Open the Demo

1. **Directly in Browser**: Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer to open it in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or Safari.
2. **Via Local Server (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or using Node
   npx serve
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

## 🔐 Demo Login Credentials

Login has Cashier and Admin tabs with role validation. Passwords are stored only as salted SHA-256 hashes in `js/auth.js` (not plain text). The 1-click demo box is shown only on `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `file://`.

| Role | Username | Password | Default Redirect | Accessible Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cashier** | `cashier` | `12345678` | `pos.html` | POS Billing, Barcode Scanning, Live Cart, Thermal Receipts, Held Bills |
| **Admin** | `admin` | `12345678` | `admin.html` | Full IMS Dashboard, Analytics, Products CRUD, Stock In, Reports, Settings |

> **Demo only.** `12345678` is a weak password. Change it before sharing this publicly: open the login page console and run `Auth.hash('admin', 'new-password').then(console.log)`, then paste the result into `passwordHash` in `js/auth.js`.
> This is a frontend-only demo, so it can be bypassed from the browser. Real security comes with the Laravel backend.
